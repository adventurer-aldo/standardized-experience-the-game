[ACTUAL TO-DO]
1. Redo questions as subjects instead of Hashes to make it easier for coding
2. Make a new scene for correcting a quiz
3. See if there's a way to improve performance when iterating questions or answers (maybe the new org will solve this)
4. Ways to navigate to and from each scene
5. Indicator displaying which scene I'm at
6. Solve the issue with images not displaying in quizzes
99. Add a Hub (Shows stuff like my stats and my practice stuff)

[FEATURES]
 - Show X amount of questions found before and X amount of questions seen for the first time
AKA Question LINKS
Basically you could draw like a mindmap of a question, with children question (maybe those only show up after the first one has been solved.)
You could decide it being a true child (only shows up when parent has been defeated) or false child (is like a branch question)
Schema question type

 - OST based on overall journey progress as well as how you're faring on the test
 - SFX when writing

 - Way to compare present and past tests (to see how far you've come)
 - Surprise comparison test (do the same test you've done before)

 - Particles *-_-*-_-*-_-*-_-*

 - Some guy/girl's voiceover for stuff like cheers and more
 - More cheers (and actually for more specific scenarios)

 - Question board (basically write all in the notepad like some sort of programming language)
